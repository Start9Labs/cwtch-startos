# Instructions

## Using Cwtch Server

When you run Cwtch on the Embassy, you are running your *own* Cwtch server instance, rather than using someone else's and trusting them.

## Using your Server Bundle

When you first run your Cwtch server, it will generate a tor address for your server, and a server bundle. This server can be used for cwtch groups. **There is no need to use a cwtch server for direct messages between cwtch clients**.

The Server Bundle can be found on the Cwtch Properties Page.
