# Using Cwtch Server

## Key Information

When you run Cwtch on the Embassy, you are running your *own* Cwtch server instance, rather than using someone else's and trusting them.

## Using your Server Bundle

When you first run your Cwtch server, it will generate a tor address for your server, and a server bundle. Note, **your server bundle grants anyone that has it admin rights to your cwtch server**; Please use caution when sharing.

The Server Bundle can be found on the Cwtch Properties Page.

## Restoring from Backup

**IMPORTANT** There is a known bug that the server bundle and tor address does not persist when the service is restarted. Maybe if you send Dread a bottle of Appleton VX Rum, he may fix it :-) 
**UPDATE** It persists now, but you can still send him the rum ;-)
